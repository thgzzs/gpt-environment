# GPT Environment

This repository contains small demos exploring procedural graphics in the browser. The demos are kept simple so the code can be easily read and modified.

## Running the Demo

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This serves the files under `public/` using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to view `public/index.html`.

If you prefer not to use Vite you can run any static file server from the repository root and open `public/index.html` directly.

## Building

To create a bundled build run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be placed in the `dist/` directory (created by Vite).
